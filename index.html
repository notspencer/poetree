  <h1>To be a father</h1>
  <p>
I am going to be a father.<br>
What qualifies me as such?<br>
Was I born with the instincts or were they learned?<br>
Am I still learning?<br>
Of course I am. Every day.<br>
Every day, a little closer to meeting this being for the first time.<br>
A little closer to meeting a new part of myself.<br>
Not that this little one is a part of myself, but rather.<br>
My perspective shifts a little, from boy, son, man...<br>
To father, caretaker, provider.<br>
Confidant, encourager, co-head of household.<br>
To lead those who choose you is one thing.<br>
But to lead those who have no choice,<br>
This will take something new. This will take a father.<br>
But not like the one that came before, not exactly.<br>
I will be a lover of life, of laughter, of light.<br>
The encourager, through highs and lows.<br>
When I am low, remembering to support high.<br> 
To lift, uplift, and in patience, recognize that I, though a father I may be.<br>
Am not perfect, but learning to build this life now for not only myself,<br>
But to give this new life a warm nook to thrive.<br>
To be a father.<br>
