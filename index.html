  <h1>To be a father</h1>
  <p>
    I am going to be a father.<br>
    What qualifies me as such?<br>
    Was I born with the instincts or were they learned?<br>
    Am I still learning?<br>
    Of course I am. Every day.<br>
    Every day, a little closer to meeting this being for the first time.<br>
    A little closer to meeting a new part of myself.<br>
    Not that this little one is a part of myself, but rather.<br>
    My perspective shifts a little, from boy, son, man...<br>
    To father, caretaker, provider.<br>
    Confidant, encourager, co-head of household.<br>
    To lead those who choose you is one thing.<br>
    But to lead those who have no choice,<br>
    This will take something new. This will take a father.<br>
    But not like the one that came before, not exactly.<br>
    I will be a lover of life, of laughter, of light.<br>
    The encourager, through highs and lows.<br>
    When I am low, remembering to support high.<br> 
    To lift, uplift, and in patience, recognize that I, though a father I may be.<br>
    Am not perfect, but learning to build this life now for not only myself,<br>
    But to give this new life a warm nook to thrive.<br>
    To be a father.<br>

    <h1>A little announcement</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to berlin.<br>
      Welcome to home.<br>
      We welcome you here, to this place, with this poem.<br>
      These moments so few<br>
      And so far in between,<br>
      You&#39;re here for our wedding, but it&#39;s not what it seems.<br>
      You came all this way<br>
      For our big, special day.<br>
      But there&#39;s more here to celebrate, we have something to say.<br>
      What could it be<br>
      This something to share<br>
      We love that you&#39;re here, so it&#39;s time to lay bare.<br>
      This years been a lot<br>
      So much and so fast,<br>
      It&#39;s hard to keep track, but the best&#39;s saved for last.<br>
      Our family here, now.<br>
      The feeling&#39;s so fun,<br>
      We&#39;re happy to share, Bing-Kaltwasser plus one.<br>
